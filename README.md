Multispectral image pan sharpening with PCA

This is an example of how to perform pan sharpening with linear principal
component analysis.

Figures resulting from applying ```imshow``` to the computed image matrices
are included under the ```fig``` directory.

See my blog post for step-by-step explanation.

The implementation is in Matlab. Feel free to use and improve!
